Let`s start with LinkedHashMaps, iterations were in sequence of elements adding because every entry in this map contains link to
element which was added before and element which was added after it.

HashMap iterates through buckets(linked lists) so default HashMap`s with String keys iterations were "random" because of
difference in hash codes. <- most effective key variant

HashMap with hash code of first 4 chars iterations were "random" too, however efficiency of distribution by buckets
far worse than default String keys. <- second by efficiency

HashMap with length of String hash code distributes values by buckets by their length(same length same bucket)
in such situation in situation with same articles length hashMap will become linked list which critically ineffective <- most ineffective

(LinkedHashMap and HashMap share conclusions of hashcode generating variant efficiency)
