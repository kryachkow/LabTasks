Appending 1 entry to a map increases file size by 47 bytes
Appending same map increases file size by 5 bytes
Appending additional map with another link increases size by 55 bytes
Appending additional map with another links increases size by 166 bytes

Compressing reduced size by 103 bytes in case with one map and by 217 bytes in case with to maps contain different objects
